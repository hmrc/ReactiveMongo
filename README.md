# ReactiveMongo

**Deprecated** This fork has been deprecated.

ReactiveMongo is a scala driver that provides fully non-blocking and asynchronous I/O operations.

## Usage

In your `project/Build.scala`:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.reactivemongo" %% "reactivemongo" % "VERSION"
)
```

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.reactivemongo/reactivemongo_2.11/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.reactivemongo/reactivemongo_2.11/)

## Build manually

To benefit from the latest improvements and fixes, you may want to compile ReactiveMongo from source. You will need a [Git client](http://git-scm.com/) and [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org).

From the shell, first checkout the source:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:ReactiveMongo/ReactiveMongo.git
```

Then go to the `ReactiveMongo` directory and launch the SBT build console:

```
$ cd ReactiveMongo
$ sbt
> +publish-local
```
